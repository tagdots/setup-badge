## üòé Why you need setup-badge?
**setup-badge** empowers you to create `dynamic` and `static` endpoint badges to showcase on your README file.

In a dynamic badge, the `message` changes over time.  For instance, code coverage percentage and software version.  In a static badge, the `message` does not change regularly over time.  For instance, license and programming language.

_p.s. `message` refers to the right side of a badge_
